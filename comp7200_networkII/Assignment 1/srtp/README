COMS7200 - Assignment 1 - A Simple Reliable Transport Protocol and File Transfer Application : By Gayatri, Ksenia, Rojesh and Romaan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The ROOT of this folder contains the following directories:
1. client - consists of all source code related to ftclient 
2. server - consists of all source code related to ftserver
3. docs - all the documentation, snapshots, test files used to test the program
4. makefile - script to run make
5. README - this file itself
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile the program change the directory to the ROOT directory (we define ROOT
directory as the directory containing our client, server and docs directory) and execute the
below command:

make

This generates two binary executables:
1. ftclient (in client directory)
2. ftserver (in server directory)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run the program, open two or more terminals:

Terminal 1: 
	change directory to server
	start the server using the below command
	
	./ftserver [-d] <port>

Terminal 2 or more:
	change directory to client
	execute the client using below command
	
	./ftclient [-d] <server> <port> <filename>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
More on BUILD:
 Execute "make dist" from ROOT directory to clean and package. A archive is created in
 the parent folder of ROOT.

 Execute "make clean" from ROOT directory to clean. This cleans all the files except .c and .h
in server and client directories.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALSO SEE:

 Docs folder contains the implementation report, test file that can be used to test the data transfer and the snapshots.
